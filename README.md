# Sprottenflotte Prediction Tool

- Current Version available with this link: [https://sprottenflottev102.streamlit.app/](https://sprottenflottev102.streamlit.app/)

## Overview

The Sprottenflotte Prediction Tool is an advanced application built using Streamlit that predicts the availability of bicycles using machine learning techniques. By integrating live data from various APIs, the tool provides real-time predictions and insights. It leverages different predictive models, including deep learning models (e.g., BiLSTM) and ensemble techniques like Random Forest. The primary aim is to enhance service efficiency by anticipating bicycle availability across different stations, aiding in better resource allocations.

## Architecture

The architecture of the Sprottenflotte Prediction Tool is centered around several interconnected Python modules, with the main application script `app.py` orchestrating the overall operation of the Streamlit web application. `app.py` serves as the core of the tool, initializing the Streamlit interface, managing user interactions, and setting up the page configuration. It handles model selection between Random Forest and Deep Learning, loads necessary data, and executes the prediction process. Supporting this, `app_functions.py` contains utility functions essential for data manipulation and interface operations, such as displaying messages, filtering data frames, and organizing station data for visualization.

Data management is handled by `data.py`, which retrieves and synchronizes data from external APIs and updates datasets on GitHub, ensuring that the application always uses the most recent data. Predictions are generated by the `predictions_dl.py` and `predictions_rf.py` modules, which process data through a BiLSTM model and a Random Forest model, respectively. These modules perform necessary data transformations and update the results for integration back into the main application. Together, these components form a cohesive infrastructure that supports real-time predictions and dynamic data visualization, ensuring the application is both scalable and maintainable.

## Functionality

Here are some functionalities of the backend of the Application:

- To add a new station, insert a new line in the stations.csv file with all the column information. The data is automatically requested and integrated into the application
- Data is only stored for the last 24 hours and forecasts are only made for the next 5 hours
- Data is only requested once per hour and forecasts are also only created once per hour
- The user can choose between two forecast models
